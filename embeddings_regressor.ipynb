       "'There are no habitat data  available for this species because locality records are all too inexact to make  useful deductions. However, Paraphytus species are  known to be restricted to tropical rainforests where one species (Paraphytus aphodioides Boucomont  1928) has been shown to breed within rotting logs using the debris and digested  wood droppings from other insects to construct a brood within which an egg is  laid (Cambefort and Walter 1985). This brood is tended  by the female. Such specialized habits probably explain the rarity of the  African species in collections. Owing to the probable inaccuracy of the locality  data, the coincidence with ecoregions is provided only  for two of the records. Unfortunately, neither of these is that of the type  locality.  The Arebi record coincides with  the edge of the Northeastern Congolian lowland forests  (AT0124) ecoregion and the island of Säo Tomé entirely comprises part of the Säo Tomé and Príncipe moist lowland forests (AT0127) ecoregion, although rainfall varies from 1,000 mm in the  north to over 4,000 mm per annum in the south (ecoregions based on Olson et al.  2001).  The unverified locality record  from Congo (DRC) shows an altitudinal occurrence at 893 m, where annual rainfall  is 1,505 mm, and annual temperature 23.3oC (max. +  min. /2).'"
